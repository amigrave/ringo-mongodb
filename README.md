MongoDB driver for Ringo.js
===========================

**ringo-mongodb** is a CommonJS-compliant JavaScript driver for the Mongo database.
It wraps the [official Java driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver) and emulates its behavior, while adding some
JavaScript sugar and convenience methods.

Mongodb's Extended JSON format and BSON support is provided by [mongodb-rhino](http://code.google.com/p/mongodb-rhino/)
also included in this project.

WIP - This is a work in progress
